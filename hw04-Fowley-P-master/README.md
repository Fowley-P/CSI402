Basic pointer work in C, complete with Travis build requirements. 

Adds and removes items from a linked list. If more than one of the same object is added to the list, instead of adding a second of the same object the number of that object is updated. If fewer than the total number of an object are removed from the list, the total number of the object is reduced instead of removing the object.
